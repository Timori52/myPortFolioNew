<p align="center">

</p>

This is my personal 3D portfolio project built using **Vite + React + Three.js**. It showcases my journey as a **Frontend Developer** and serves as an interactive space to present my work and resume.

Initially inspired by the [JavaScript Mastery tutorial](https://youtu.be/0fYi8SGA20k?feature=shared), I extended it with my own improvements and personalization.

### 🔧 Work Done Beyond the Tutorial:
- Removed unused CSS & assets
- Removed extra animations for better UX
- Improved UI performance
- Added a working **Download Resume** button
- Solved responsiveness issues and improved mobile view
- Polished design to reflect my developer brand
